        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Kevin, I am a tech degree student at Team Treehouse.  When I first started learning about computer programming, I was unsure where to 
          find information.  I am a quick learner, so attending a college for four years was a little farfetch'd for me.  My friend refered me to Team Treehouse, and
          since then I use it everyday.  It is reasurring that the teachers on Treehouse know their material, and are very good at teaching it.  
            I attended the University of Cincinnati for business and respiratory care for six years.  I have to say, every one of Treehouse's teachers have been better than 
          my professors.  Im excited that I have this opportunity to become a successful coder!  </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master everything there is to know about computer programming.  Before I master all, these are the ones I'm going to focus on first.</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
          <li>Java</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My goal profession is to become a freelancer from home, and eventually start my own computer programming company, with trained personel.  My dream 
          would have been to play in the PGA, because golf is my favorite sport to play.  I landed on computer programming because it is a more 
          obtainable goal, and I absolutely love to code!  When it comes time to impress other professionals with my services, I will not let them down.</p>
